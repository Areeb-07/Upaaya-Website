        <h2 class="blog-title">Care giving - A key link in managing mental health disorders</h2>
        <p class="blog-content">
            "Make Mental Health and well being for all a global priority”,  is the theme for World Health Day 2022. Nearly one billion people are affected by at least some form of mental disorders across the world according to a recent 2022 WHO report. There is an increasing and urgent need to share experiences in addressing mental health disorders to remove stigma, myths and mis-conception on managing them. <br> <br>

            The article emphasizes that mental disorders can be managed long term just like chronic physical problems like diabetes , heart disease, cancers which also cannot be cured completely but can be managed long term with medical support with the person performing their social and work functions. The management includes meeting a doctor, possibly a psychiatrist immediately, adhering to the medication at home and follow up diligently. This I would like to reiterate is the best solution since we have followed a trajectory of denial, delay  due to stigma, lack of awareness of possible solutions and whether treatment works or not. This is our story in third person written by a colleague who works with a mental health support group. <br> <br>
            
            Young Sachin and Uday always looked up to their caring and devoted mother. She was highly educated and a brilliant academic – a PhD in Child development, book publisher and a dedicated teacher and loving mother in the 90s . But they were confused when she suddenly seemed to undergo a personality change when they were in middle school. <br> <br>
            
            Sometimes she became angry and agitated and at other times she imagined that certain people in her life were imposters who she believed wished to steal her belongings. Her intellectual faculties were intact and she continued to teach, write , play her banjo, weave excellent woollen sweaters, take tutions, but her suspicions gradually grew so much so that she was often overwhelmed by them. Her sense of hygiene suffered and it was not long before she was unable to function effectively at her teaching job. <br> <br>
            
            In the beginning, they failed to realize that the behavioural changes could be due to a medical condition and could be addressed and maybe it is her personality now due to which she is doing this. It was incredibly stressful to deal with her condition as one felt that nothing could be done and it is she who is to be blamed or  just letting it be due to the stigma. <br> <br>
            
            The family  went through bouts of apprehension and shame as they were confused and not always sure how best to address it or share as there was a culture of silence or anger around discussing it. They had to carry on with their studies , household chores also which included looking after managing their food as mummy’s function had deteriorated. It also became difficult to invite people at their place or attend social functions as she was not keeping well and sometimes due to the embarrassment.  People also were not of help with solutions as they judge you from their lenses around many parameters. <br> <br>
            
            The anguish during that period was compounded by the fact that no help was forthcoming from people around friends/relatives simply due to lack of awareness and acceptance of mental health conditions and therefore the lack of compassion and understanding for the young caregivers. This gets compounded by equations in the families. <br> <br>
            
            Till this time she was having some problem but it was not known what it was as any discussion around was more around blaming family, her problem being perceived as weakness, being strong etc. This period was a struggle with helplessness and not knowing what could be done to address this behavior and the social fallout. These chain of events continued for a few years and were broken due to more awareness in the late 90s.  <br> <br>
            
            After coming to terms with the social stigma and with the increased awareness about mental health, the family was able to  seek medical attention again. A psychiatrist again rightly diagnosed it as paranoid schizophrenia as the diganosis had receded in the background trying to blame it on personal characteristics for a few years. He prescribed the appropriate medication which resulted in a dramatic improvement of their mother’s symptoms and gradually she was able to resume her work and daily functions. <br> <br>
            
            She sometimes suffered a minor relapse in terms of her behavior, symptoms but her caregivers did not give up their struggle to care for her every need. She got back to her teaching within a month of medication, nearly after 7 years of her symptom exacerbation and since has not looked back and leads a active work and personal life. It could have been easy if there was more awareness on identification and treatment of mental disorders and to funnel it appropriately from a physician or general practitioner. <br> <br>
            
            Sadly, awareness and. a step-up approach is absent and it leads to immense pain, isolation and suffering for the families to find out solutions. It does not help as the society is indifferent to mental problems and the rat race towards success makes people turn a blind eye to these problems when it is a very small helping hand in most cases which can change lives. It is also too large a jump to make in smaller town a few decades back and opaqueness persisted of the entire diagnosis and treatment journey.  The patients face the symptoms and need help. They are perceived as violent and dangerous as per the myths propagated in our movies which is not true. <br> <br>
            
            Caregiving is another piece of this journey <br> <br>
            
            Financial, mental, emotional, social & physical problems faced by the caregivers in the course of this arduous journey takes a toll and can tire a person. Wisely enough they decided to address their own problems by seeking counsel and help. They understood that asking for support is not an act of indulgence but an act of survival and they need not feel guilty about it. They focused on getting proper rest & nutrition, exercise & stress management and were able to effectively cope with the challenges of the caregiving journey. Learning meditation and keeping oneself engaged in professional life helps. <br> <br>
            
            Stigma and subsequent discrimination hampers social connects and companionship as families are not understanding enough and lack the holistic approach. They don’t understand that apart from just medication, even counselling, holistic approach and home rehabilitation can help a person. Not every person needs institutional care. People feel that caregivers are aloof but one is really struggling with the enormity of the disease, the emotional ramifications and social stigma. <br> <br>
            
            Sachin and Uday finished their post graduation successfully managing their lives and supporting their parents as their father was diagnosed with Parkinsonism which is also a very difficult irreversible disease and requires highest level of caregiving and coordination. Now seasoned caregivers, Sachin and Uday  managed to coordinate care for their  father over the next few years – again embracing stress in the face of disease and despair. Caregiving for their mother was also ongoing simultaneously and fortunately she was stable with treatment.  <br> <br>
            
            Caregiving , studying and working in a tough journey and very few people empathise with this journey and hence important to stay compassionate towards self. People around , academic and work places are not aware due to many reasons as care giving is energy sapping which they are not aware of as sometimes everyday is a challenge sometimes. <br> <br>
            
            Care givers only need space and time to re-energize and get back but our systems need to be flexible to accomodate  and hence this affects the person they are taking care of. At a very early stage in life, they have learnt that the way to ensure a better quality of life for the caregiver and their loved one is through self-care, seeking help and counseling. <br> <br>
            
            This ends the third person narration. <br> <br>
            
            Society needs to create more spaces to help people with mental problems and their families and discuss these needs and have conversations around them. Hopefully people are slightly more aware due to the mental suffering as a result of the pandemic.As I completed writing this , one of my favourite cricketers Kapil Dev commented during a public meet that there is nothing such as depression or pressure if one is having money and facilities. It is though distressing as one has suffered due to these misconceptions as mental health problems can affect anyone and everybody is vulnerable. Holding on to these views only hampers seeking help and feel stigmatised where we were stuck for few years as a family. Mental health disorders affected many before the pandemic but it was still battling myths of weakness , strength , poor to rich only get it etc etc. The pandemic has bought it to the forefront due to sudden acceleration and magnitude of the mental and physical aspects of it. Hope we learn our lessons to address these ahead. <br> <br>
            
            Based on experience , I feel that once the family is on the trajectory of care , social support is needed for the person to get back and interact with people around which happens with physical disorders. This is not happening easily. Also, the caregivers need support at their academic institutions ,workplaces, relatives for example to support patients who might need care for a brief period. Also, My current experience of interacting for insurance with health providers also is disappointing as they do not respond for insurance coverage despite the mental health act 2017 provisions. It would make it easier for people to seek care with insurance coverage for physical and mental health conditions simultaneously.  Social and financial support can quicken social integration. Technology post pandemic can bridge logistic and access gaps for people staying far away and in smaller towns , older persons or who cannot visit a health provider for a follow up in bigger towns or within a large city after the initial visit for medication and symptom check. Mental health does not lie in the hands of a mental health provider or an institution only but it also exists in the different parts of our life like academics, workplaces , social structures , systems and being sensitive to these problems. A serious attempt to reform these will reduce emotional distress and mental health disorders and lead to long term benefits for all. <br> <br>
